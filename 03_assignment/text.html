                I use â€‹Courier Prime font to reflect the typewriter effect. The idea of showing the most frequent words as a paragraph is based on letters written by a typewriter. By combining Ronald Reagan's portrait and his words, this visualization will better present a sense and the feeling of him. I chose red to highlight the text because of the Republican party. These 1000 words are listed by their frequency from all of the speeches. When viewers hover on a word, they will see the number showing as a tooltip which indicates how many times it had been mentioned in Ronald Reagan's presidential speeches.
